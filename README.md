# NYC AI Hackathon: AI for Public Good NY

## Subway-balancer
Balancing Trains for New York City Subway Systems


## Intro

To enhance the subway commuting experience for New York City residents, our project utilizes real-time carriage occupancy data to display the crowding level of the next train's specific carriages on the subway station platforms. Additionally, if a particular carriage is crowded, it provides passengers with directional recommendations (whether to move left or right).
